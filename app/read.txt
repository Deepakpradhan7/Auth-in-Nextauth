mongo- integration of next auth

auth providers - google,github, credentials



google,github -> only signin
credentials -> register (custom api),  login using signin by auth



for session-
1- create session provider so that we have a wrap to wrap our layout
2- pass session to that provider either in layout page or in provider page . session will be get from getServerSession() from next/auth.

then we can use session
1. we can use useSession() in client component/pages (it will get that session from the sessionprovider)
2. and we can directly use getServerSession() in server component/pages.
